# libtropic-stm32

This repository provides examples of how to use our official SDK, [`libtropic`](https://github.com/tropicsquare/libtropic), on STM32-based platforms (NUCLEO development kits).

Contributors, please follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/tropicsquare/libtropic-stm32/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).


 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > Example projects in separate folders demonstrate TROPIC01 connected to different NUCLEO development boards. Each project wraps [`libtropic`](https://github.com/tropicsquare/libtropic) and is ready to be cross-compiled and programmed into a Nucleo-64 or Nucleo-144 development board.

### Supported Hardware

We provide integration examples for the following NUCLEO boards:

 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > Before starting with the examples, we strongly recommend completing the following steps:
 > * Read the CHIP ID and TROPIC01's firmware versions, and **save the printed output for future reference**.
 > * Update both of TROPIC01's internal firmware components to the latest version.

Choose instruction based on hardware you want to use:
* [Nucleo F439ZI](./NUCLEO_F439ZI/README.md)
* [Nucleo L432KC](./NUCLEO_L432KC/README.md) (not currently supported)
