> [!IMPORTANT]
> Example projects in separate folders demonstrate TROPIC01 connected to different NUCLEO development boards. Each project wraps [Libtropic](https://github.com/tropicsquare/libtropic) and is ready to be cross-compiled and programmed into a Nucleo-64 or Nucleo-144 development board.

## Supported Hardware

We provide integration examples for the following NUCLEO boards:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We strongly recommend reading the [Libtropic SDK documentation](https://tropicsquare.github.io/libtropic/latest/) to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts and then going through the First Steps as described in each guide in the following list, where you will be introduced to basic examples and you will update your chip's firmware.

Choose the instructions for the hardware you want to use:
* [Nucleo F439ZI](./NUCLEO_F439ZI/README.md)
* [Nucleo L432KC](./NUCLEO_L432KC/README.md) (currently not supported)
